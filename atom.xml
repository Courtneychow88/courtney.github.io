<p>Being a Product Manager, leadership does not actually comes from your tile but the respect from your team members. Maybe the first thing you need to do is Temper Controlling.<br>
I learnt these things from an HBR article, written by <em>Daniel Goleman</em>. Helps<br>
me a lot when I got to face the dark side of me.</p>
<p><em>Manage your reaction:</em></p>
<p><em>Keep your distaste to yourself</em></p>
<ul>
<li>No complain to others</li>
<li>Keep your support connections outside the office<br>
<em>Consider whether it‚Äôs you, not them</em></li>
<li>‚ÄúStart with the hypothesis that the person is doing things you don‚Äôt like but is a good person,‚Äù</li>
<li>By better understanding what is bothering you, you may also be able to see your role in it.<br>
<em>Spend more time with them</em></li>
<li>Develop some empathy<br>
<em>Consider providing feedback</em></li>
<li>Focus on behaviors that she can control and describe how they impact you and your work together.</li>
<li>But proceed cautiously<br>
<em>Adopt a don‚Äôt-care attitude</em></li>
<li>‚Äúpractice the fine art of emotional detachment or not giving a shit.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Principles to Remember</em></p>
<p><em>Do:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Manage your own reaction to the behavior first</li>
<li>Practice emotional detachment so the person‚Äôs behaviors don‚Äôt bother you</li>
<li>Spend time trying to get to know the person and better understand what motivates him</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Don‚Äôt:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Assume that it is all about the other person ‚Äî you likely play some part</li>
<li>Commiserate with others who could be unfairly influenced by your negativity or may judge you for your complaints</li>
<li>Give feedback unless you can focus on work issues and can avoid a personal conflict</li>
</ul>
